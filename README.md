FeatureLineNet is an open source deep learning appraoch for detecting feature lines on triangulated meshed data.
This software runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.
FeatureLineNet has been developed by Martin Denk and Prof. Dr. Rother Klemens at the [University of Applied Science Munich](https://https://www.hm.edu/) at the institute for material and building research.


# Current Version
- 3D triangulated Meshes
- Detection of edges in noisy objects
- Usuage of a simple graph convolutional neuronal network (GCN)
- Keras implementation


# Usuage

```bash,example

python main.py

```
